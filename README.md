# Science Fair 2023
This repository is for the 2023 Macau inter school science fair.
This project's flowchart is essentially the following:

1. Voice Activation using NLU
2. Extract Objective
3. Face Recognition to see who the user is
4. Use word embedding to find most possible places
5. Use G-Mapping to go to the aforementioned location
6. Using YOLOv5 from Pytorch Hub to find the objective
7. G-Map back to the user
